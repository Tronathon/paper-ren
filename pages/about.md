We are a curated showcase of children's books from around the world. 

We review and feature books, as well as shine the spotlight on illustrators and authors that we admire. Paper Ren was born out of lockdown and during the first year of our daughter's life. 

Our goal is to give authors and illustrators a platform to showcase their books and illustrations and we aim to focus on books that make the world a better place. We interview authors and illustrators to give a wholesome experience into the world of picture books. 

In a world of uncertainty, there is no better time to support local bookshops, independent publishers, upcoming authors, and budding illustrators.
