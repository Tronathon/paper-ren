## Q&A with Alice Melvin

We had the pleasure of interviewing the talented illustrator Alice Melvin, about nostalgia and sentiment. Alice is a print illustrator and designer based in Edinburgh.\
\
Her books include titles such as *Grandma’s House, The High Street*, *I Am: A Book About Feelings, Me and You: A Book of Opposites* and *My Day: A Book of Actions,* all published by *Tate Publishing.* She has also produced a range of stylish, distinctive greeting cards, accessories and clothing.

PR: In your book *Grandma’s House*, you take the reader on a sentimental journey through your own memories of your *Grandma’s house*. Is there any particular object or sensory experience which sums up your time there as a young child?

> AM: “I had two favourites, one was a little china wren, and when you carefully lifted it up the three blue bead eggs that my grandma put inside would be revealed. My other favourite was a wooden apple, about the size of a real apple, which when opened up had a tiny wooden tea set inside.”

PR: How do you feel these nostalgic experiences inform your work?

> AM: “Whilst the focus of my work has shifted since *Grandma’s House* was published (in 2015), I think I am still drawn to nostalgia, probably because it can feel like a safe space in which to be, especially at times when the world around feels uncertain and troubling.”

PR: Your third book for Tate Publishing titled *The High Street*, is full of nostalgic nooks and curiosities. Are there any nostalgic objects that you collect?

> AM: “Right from being a child, there were certain objects that I held close and valued, me and my sister used to even pack our ‘treasures’ to take on holidays with us! I’d sentimentally hoard all manner of objects, placing a lot of importance on inanimate things. A number of years ago I really tried to hold this relationship up to the light and let go of many of the things that I’d carried with me for many years and it felt liberating.”

Thank you to Alice Melvin for your time. You can see more of her work on her website at www.alicemelvin.com.
