## The Story

This empowering and emotive book is a story of a mother and her child as they dance, sing, unite and breathe through an exploration of what it means to be free.\
\
“Does Freedom run through our veins? Can it be equal and maintained?”\
\
With each lyrical contemplation the words “inhale” and “exhale” follow, until the book ends on a powerful note teaching us that, “Freedom is you, Freedom is me, We are free, We are free”.

## The Illustrations

 Molly Mendoza’s vibrant and immersive illustrations flow across the pages, expressing Leon’s words perfectly. There is an explosion of colour when this book is opened, beautifully conveying the message of what it means to be free. Towards the end of the book there is a fold-out spread with a depiction of freedom, where flowers, constellations and shooting stars dance across a double spread.

## The Verdict

This book is unique, relevant and empowering, designed to uplift and inspire young readers. It is a perfect conversation starter to help children explore the big questions surrounding equality and what it means to be free. Freedom, We Sing has also received an endorsement from Amnesty International for its role in “reminding us that we are all born free and equal”.\
