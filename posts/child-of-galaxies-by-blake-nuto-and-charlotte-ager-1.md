## The Story

This book is a poetic celebration that explores the wonders of life, whilst gently provoking philosophical thought and questioning the mysteries of the universe. The story plays with scale, both expanding and contracting between the planets, stars and solar systems to more earthly retreats such as an art gallery, a field of sunflowers and a homely kitchen.\
\
Written by Blake Nuto, a trained teacher and illustrated by Charlotte Ager, Child Of Galaxies is a beautiful, joyful account of life.

## The Illustrations

Ager captures the magic of life from a child’s perspective, as she meanders between an imaginary account of the cosmos where children play amongst the moon and the stars, to a colourful depiction of the earth where they run through puddles and watch boats sail by. Each spread has a sense of wonder, acting as a perfect companion to the poetic words of Nuto.

## The Verdict

This is a timeless, boundless expression of what it means to be alive and will act as a perfect introduction to life’s big questions for curious young minds.\
