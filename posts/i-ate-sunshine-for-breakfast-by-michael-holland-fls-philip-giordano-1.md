## The Story

This is a thought-provoking ecological fable about the relationship between humanity and nature. It begins when the villagers try to utilise the forest for their personal gain by building timber shelter and tools. As the winds gather momentum, the villagers enclose themselves with an enormous timber wall. They start to become hostile and reclusive, acting suspiciously of one another. Ultimately, it was left to the children to repair and restore harmony as they find their hope in the last tree…

## The Illustrations

Drawn using a palette of greys, blues and greens with animated pencil lines, Emily Haworth-Booth executes this cautionary fable flawlessly. The colour palette is considered and the hand-drawn illustrations have an authentic and honest quality to them. In parts, there are dashes of humour within the dialogue, and for some spreads Haworth-Booth has adopted a graphic novel style layout to convey the story.

## The Verdict

The Last Tree is a powerful and relevant tale of the potential volatile relationship humanity has with nature. This important book is an intelligent depiction of how apparent innocent actions can turn into exploitative ones, if not considered harmoniously with nature. The message carried in this book is loud and clear and it is one that leaves us with the feeling of hope, rather than despair. This is an ideal book for discussing environmental issues with young readers and will be useful in an educational context.\
