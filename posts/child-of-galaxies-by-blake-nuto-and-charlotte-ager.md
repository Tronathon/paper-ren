## The Story

This is a delightful and fascinating guide to the lives of plants from around the world. Expert ecologist and author Michael Holland delves into the world of plants, covering a wide range of topics from pollination, life in the extremes, smart plant technology and the healing properties of plants. We learn about the plant extracts used in our toothpaste and how plants can be found in our musical instruments and clothing.\
\
Holland has divided the book into four essential chapters covering the fundamentals of plants, their broader world, the role they play in our everyday life and the future of plants.\
\
There are also twelve fun do-it-yourself activities dotted throughout this book. For example, did you know that the mineral-rich water found in potatoes can conduct electricity? In this book you can learn how to make a potato power plant along with a wild weed bottle garden, a plant maze and learn to write with invisible ink.

## The Illustrations

Philip Giordano’s illustrations are a visual delight and he has rendered the world of plants full of colour, texture and detail. This book is illustration-rich, and his visuals work alongside the text to describe, inform and demystify the complex world of plants. There is a unique tactile quality to Giordano’s illustrations, with hints of humour and playfulness dotted throughout.

## The Verdict

This book is an inspiring and educational addition to any young reader’s bookshelf. With the added bonus of fun activities, this book is perfect for the school holidays or stay at home weekends. It can be read from any point and the fun, clever and colourful spreads will engage and inform young readers.\
