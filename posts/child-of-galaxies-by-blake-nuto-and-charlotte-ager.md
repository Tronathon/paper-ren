## The Story

Following the success of Katie Cottle’s book, The Green Giant, this is a cautionary tale about the environmental impact of waste pollution in our oceans. Meera and her mum are enjoying time on an idyllic beach when they are suddenly splashed by a giant emerging from the waves. The blue giant carries a crucial message of the polluted ocean and urges them to help! Meera and her mum answer the giant’s request and begin to clear the ocean as best they can. But how can they possibly tackle such an enormous challenge alone…is it too late to repair the damage?

## The Illustrations

The illustrations are rich with vivid colours, depth and texture. Cottle uses animated, textured strokes to capture the motion of the giant and the waves, and a combination of reds and pinks to offset the blue hues. Each page is a visual delight, with impressive depth and attention to detail.

## The Verdict

This is a relevant eco-tale described in a way that is understandable to young readers. It is a story of hope teaching us that by working together, seemingly impossible challenges can be tackled, that is if the call to action is answered and everybody plays their part.\
\
Welcome additions at the back of the book include; helpful reminders of lifestyle choices that can help save the oceans, as well as a list of immediate changes we can make, including drinking with reusable straws and using a canvas bag when shopping.\
\
This book is an ideal conversation starter to discuss marine conservation with young readers.\
