We caught up with India from Round Table Books in Brixton, London to find out more about their bookstore.

PR: Can you tell us a little about Round Table Books?

> RTB: “We are a book shop in Brixton with a dedication to sharing inclusive, diverse titles across race, gender, socioeconomic background, sexuality and ability. Round Table Books began as a week-long pop-up shop in Brixton in 2018 by Aimée Felone and David Stevens. Their goal was to champion diverse books and combat the report that only 1% of children’s books featured a Black or minority ethnic main character. After a hugely successful pop up and crowdfunder with support from the local community Round Table Books was born!”

PR: What are your current top 3 children’s books in-store and why?

> *Look Up!* by Nathan Byron and Dapo Adeola
>
> RTB: “We don’t go a day without recommending this beautiful book. Wonderful illustrations and Rocket’s determination and star obsession brings any one who reads it so much joy!”
>
> *SLAY* by Brittney Morris
>
> RTB: “Kiera Johnson 17 year old college student by day and Video game developer by night! A book about harnessing your community, protecting your craft and following your dreams. Wildly entertaining!”
>
> *Akissi: Tales of Mischief* by Marguerite Abouet
>
> RTB: “A hilarious comic following the cheeky Akissi as she tries to stay out of mischief in her village in the Ivory Coast. Playful, aesthetically pleasing bold illustrations and lots and lots of humour.”

PR: If you could be granted one wish for the future of all bookstores what would it be?

> RTB: “We hope that bookstores continue to get the support they need in order to support the communities they’re in! Bookstores provide a safe space for so many people and we’d love to see this continue to flourish. We also hope to see more diverse and inclusive titles in all bookstores, absolutely everyone deserves to see themselves represented in the titles on our shelves!”

A big thank you to India and Round Table Books for your time.
