## The Story

This is a poetic exploration of a young girl’s boundless imagination as she comprehends the possibilities that lie beyond the horizon. Drawing parallels between the unreachable horizon and the infinite nature of our imaginations, the book alters perspectives varying from bird-eye views to cropped views, to uncover the endless potential of the imagination.

## The Illustrations

Carolina Celas’ mediative illustrations perfectly complement her poetic words. The abstract views, tranquil colour palette with bright accents, and philosophical content give the book a dreamlike quality, with a degree of reality.

## The Verdict

This book beautifully explores the potential of our imagination and ponders on questions of reality and possibility. Through the exploration of a young child, we attempt to chase the horizon to find it always seems ungraspable, much like the edge of our imaginations. This is a beautifully illustrated poetic book and perfect for little creative thinkers.
